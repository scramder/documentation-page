            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the 
              presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects 
              such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be
              rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.</p>
            <p>CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across 
              Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, the development 
              of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed 
              the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about 
              CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, 
              everything is now CSS without a version number.</p>
            <p>After CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased significantly and 
              the progress on different CSS modules started to differ so much, that it 
              became more effective to develop and release recommendations separately per 
              module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C now periodically 
              takes a snapshot of the latest stable state of the CSS specification and individual modules progress. CSS modules now have version
              numbers, or levels, such as CSS Color Module Level 5.</p>

            <p>For a beginner-level introduction to the syntax of selectors, see our 
              guide on CSS Selectors. Be aware that any syntax error in a rule definition
              invalidates the entire rule. Invalid rules are ignored by the browser. 
              Note that CSS rule definitions are entirely (ASCII) text-based, whereas 
              DOM-CSS / CSSOM (the rule management system) is object-based.</p>

          <article>
            <p>The following are the various selectors, which allow styles to be conditional 
              based on various features of elements within the DOM.</p>
            <h2>Basic selectors</h2>
            <p>Basic selectors are fundamental selectors; these are the most basic selectors 
              that are frequently combined to create other, more complex selectors.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Universal selector <span class="selectors"> * </span></li>
              <li>Type selector <span class="selectors"> elementname </span></li>
              <li>Class selector <span class="selectors"> .classname </span></li>
              <li>ID selector <span class="selectors"> #idname </span></li>
              <li>Attribute selector <span class="selectors"> [attr=value] </span></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Grouping selectors</h2>
            <h3>Selector list <span class="selectors">A, B</span></h3>
            <p>Specifies that both A and B elements are selected. This is a grouping method to 
              select several matching elements.</p>
            <h3>Combinators</h3>
            <p>Combinators are selectors that establish a relationship between two or more 
              simple selectors, such as "A is a child of B" or "A is adjacent to B", creating 
              a complex selector.</p>
            <h3>Adjacent sibling combinator A + B</h3>
            <p>Specifies that the elements selected by both A and B have the same parent and 
              that the element selected by B immediately follows the element selected by A 
              horizontally.</p>
            <h3>General sibling combinator A ~ B</h3>
            <p>Specifies that the elements selected by both A and B share the same parent 
              and that the element selected by A comes before—but not necessarily immediately 
              before—the element selected by B.</p>
            <h3>Child combinator A > B</h3>
            <p>Specifies that the element selected by B is a descendant of the element 
              selected by A, but is not necessarily a direct child.</p>
            <h3>Column combinator A || B Experimental</h3>
            <p>Specifies that the element selected by B is located within the table column 
              specified by A. Elements which span multiple columns are considered to be a 
              member of all of those columns.</p>
            <h2>Pseudo</h2>
            <h3>Pseudo classes :</h3>
            <p>Specifies a special state of the selected element(s).</p>
            <h3>Pseudo elements ::</h3>
            <p>Represents entities that are not included in HTML.</p>

          <header>What is CSS?</header>
          <article>
            <p>Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language 
              either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to selectively 
              style HTML elements. For example, this CSS selects paragraph text, 
              setting the color to red:</p>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">
              p {
                color: red;
              }
            </code></pre>
            <p>Let's try it out! Using a text editor, paste the three lines of CSS 
              (above) into a new file. Save the file as <span class="selectors">style.css</span> in a directory named 
              <span class="selectors">styles</span>.</p>
              <p>To make the code work, we still need to apply this CSS (above) to your 
                HTML document. Otherwise, the styling won't change the appearance of 
                the HTML. (If you haven't been following our project, pause here to 
                read <a class="link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Dealing_with_files">Dealing with files</a> 
                and <a class="link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics">HTML basics</a> HTML basics.)</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>Open your <span class="selectors">index.html</span> file. Paste the following line in the head 
                  (between the <span class="selectors">&lthead&gt</span> and <span class="selectors">&lt/head&gt</span> tags):</p>
                <pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;link href="styles/style.css" rel="stylesheet" /&gt;</code></pre>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Save <span class="selectors">index.html</span> and load it in your browser. You should see something like this:</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/website-screenshot-styled.png" alt="moz_img">
            <p>If your paragraph text is red, congratulations! Your CSS is working.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Anatomy of a CSS ruleset</h2>
            <p>Let's dissect the CSS code for red paragraph text to understand how it works:</p>
            <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/css-declaration-small.png" alt="css">
            <p>The whole structure is called a ruleset. (The term ruleset is often 
              referred to as just rule.) Note the names of the individual parts:</p>
            <h2>Selector</h2>
            <p>This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines 
              the element(s) to be styled (in this example, <span class="selectors">&ltp&gt</span> elements). To 
              style a different element, change the selector.</p>
            <h2>Declaration</h2>
            <p>This is a single rule like <span class="selectors">color: red;</span>. It specifies which of the 
              element's properties you want to style.</p>
            <h2>Properties</h2>
            <p>These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this 
              example, <span class="selectors">color</span> is a property of the <span class="selectors">&ltp&gt</span> elements.) In CSS, you choose 
              which properties you want to affect in the rule.</p>
            <h2>Property value</h2>
            <p>To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. 
              This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. 
              (For example, there are many <span class="selectors">color</span> values in addition to <span class="selectors">red</span>.)</p>
            <h2>Note the other important parts of the syntax:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. <span class="selectors">({})</span></p>
                </li>
              <li>
                <p>Within each declaration, you must use a colon <span class="selectors">(:)</span> to separate the 
                property from its value or values.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon <span class="selectors">(;)</span> to separate each declaration 
                from the next one.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>To modify multiple property values in one ruleset, write them separated 
              by semicolons, like this:</p>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">
              p {
                color: red;
                width: 500px;
                border: 1px solid black;
              }
            </code></pre>
            <h2>Selecting multiple elements</h2>
            <p>You can also select multiple elements and apply a single ruleset to all of 
              them. Separate multiple selectors by commas. For example:</p>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">
              p,
              li,
              h1 {
                color: red;
              }
            </code></pre>
            <h1>Different types of selectors</h1>
            <p>There are many different types of selectors. The examples above use element 
              selectors, which select all elements of a given type. But we can make more 
              specific selections as well. Here are some of the more common types of selectors:</p>
              <table class="standard-table no-markdown">
                <thead>
                  <tr>
                    <th scope="col">Selector name</th>
                    <th scope="col">What does it select</th>
                    <th scope="col">Example</th>
                  </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                  <tr>
                    <td>Element selector (sometimes called a tag or type selector)</td>
                    <td>All HTML elements of the specified type.</td>
                    <td><code>p</code><br>selects <code>&lt;p&gt;</code></td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>ID selector</td>
                    <td>
                      The element on the page with the specified ID. On a given HTML page,
                      each id value should be unique.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                      <code>#my-id</code><br>selects <code>&lt;p id="my-id"&gt;</code> or
                      <code>&lt;a id="my-id"&gt;</code>

            <p>Now that we've explored some CSS fundamentals, let's improve the 
              appearance of the example by adding more rules and information to 
              the style.css file.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>First,<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/What_will_your_website_look_like#font">find the output from Google Fonts</a> that you previously

                    element somewhere inside your <span class="selectors">index.html</span> head (anywhere between

                    It was a good test, but let's not continue with lots of red text.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Add the following lines (shown below), replacing the <span class="selectors">font-family</span> 
                    assignment with your <span class="selectors">font-family</span> selection from 
                    <a class="link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/What_will_your_website_look_like#font">What will your website look like?</a>. 
                    The property <span class="selectors">font-family</span> refers to the font(s) you want 
                    to use for text. This rule defines a global base font and font size for 
                    the whole page. Since <span class="selectors"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html">&lthtml&gt</a></span>  is the parent element of the whole 
                    page, all elements inside it inherit the same <span class="selectors">font-size</span> and <span class="selectors">font-family</span>.</p>
                  <pre><code class="lang-css">

                      font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif; /* this should be the rest of the output you got from Google Fonts */
                    }

                  <p class="note">Note: Anything in CSS between /* and */ is a CSS comment. 
                    The browser ignores comments as it renders the code. CSS comments are

                    heading. Finally, let's expand the second ruleset (below) with settings 
                    for line height and letter spacing to make body content more readable.</p>

            <p>Adjust the <span class="selectors">px</span> values as you like. Your work-in-progress should look similar to this:</p>

          <article>
            <p>Something you'll notice about writing CSS: a lot of it is about boxes. 
              This includes setting size, color, and position. Most HTML elements on 
              your page can be thought of as boxes sitting on top of other boxes.</p>

            <p>CSS layout is mostly based on the box model. Each box taking up space 
              on your page has properties like:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><span class="selectors">padding</span>, the space around the content. In the example below, it is 
                the space around the paragraph text.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><span class="selectors">border</span>, the solid line that is just outside the padding.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><span class="selectors">margin</span>, the space around the outside of the border.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>In this section we also use:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><span class="selectors">width</span> (of an element).</p>
              </li>
              <li>

              <li>
                <p><span class="selectors">color</span>, the color of an element's content (usually text).</p>

              <li>
                <p><span class="selectors">text-shadow</span> sets a drop shadow on the text inside an element.</p>

              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>To continue, let's add more CSS. Keep adding these new rules at the 
              bottom of <span class="selectors">style.css</span>. Experiment with changing values to see what happens.</p>
            <h2>Changing the page color</h2>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">
              html {
                background-color: #00539f;
              }
              
            </code></pre>
            <p>This rule sets a background color for the entire page. Change the color 
              code to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/What_will_your_website_look_like#theme_color">the color you chose in What will my website look like?</a> .</p>
            <h2>Styling the body</h2>
            <pre><code class="lang-css">
              body {
                width: 600px;
                margin: 0 auto;
                background-color: #ff9500;
                padding: 0 20px 20px 20px;
                border: 5px solid black;
              }  
            </code></pre>
            <p>There are several declarations for the <span class="selectors"><a class="link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body">&ltbody&gt</a></span>  element. Let's go through 
              these line-by-line:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p><span class="selectors">width: 600px;</span>  This forces the body to always be 600 pixels wide.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><span class="selectors">margin: 0 auto;</span> When you set two values on a property like <span class="selectors">margin</span> or 
                  <span class="selectors">padding</span>, the first value affects the element's top and bottom side 
                  (setting it to <span class="selectors">0</span> in this case); the second value affects the left and 
                  right side. (Here, <span class="selectors">auto</span> is a special value that divides the available 
                  horizontal space evenly between left and right). You can also use one, 
                  two, three, or four values, as documented in <a class="link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin#syntax">Margin Syntax</a>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><span class="selectors">background-color: #FF9500;</span> This sets the element's background color. 
                  This project uses a reddish orange for the body background color, as 
                  opposed to dark blue for the <span class="selectors"><a class="link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html">&lthtml&gt</a></span>element. (Feel free to experiment.)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><span class="selectors">padding: 0 20px 20px 20px; </span> This sets four values for padding. The goal 
                  is to put some space around the content. In this example, there is no 
                  padding on the top of the body, and 20 pixels on the right, bottom and 
                  left. The values set top, right, bottom, left, in that order. As with 
                  <span class="selectors">margin</span>, you can use one, two, three, or four values, as documented in 
                  <a class="link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding#syntax">Padding Syntax</a>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><span class="selectors">border: 5px solid black;</span> This sets values for the width, style and 
                    color of the border. In this case, it's a five-pixel-wide, solid black 
                    border, on all sides of the body.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Positioning and styling the main page title</h2>
              <pre><code class="lang-css">
                h1 {
                  margin: 0;
                  padding: 20px 0;
                  color: #00539f;
                  text-shadow: 3px 3px 1px black;
                }            
              </code></pre>
              <p>You may have noticed there's a horrible gap at the top of the body. That 
                happens because browsers apply default styling to the <span class="selectors"><a class="selectors" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements">&lth1&gt</a></span>  element 
                (among others). That might seem like a bad idea, but the intent is to 
                provide basic readability for unstyled pages. To eliminate the gap, we 
                overwrite the browser's default styling with the setting margin: 0;.</p>
              <p>Next, we set the heading's top and bottom padding to 20 pixels.</p>
              <p>Following that, we set the heading text to be the same color as the 
                HTML background color.</p>
              <p>Finally, <span class="selectors">text-shadow</span>applies a shadow to the text content of the element.
                Its four values are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>The first pixel value sets the horizontal offset of the shadow from 
                    the text: how far it moves across.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>The second pixel value sets the vertical offset of the shadow from 
                    the text: how far it moves down.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>The third pixel value sets the blur radius of the shadow. A larger 
                    value produces a more fuzzy-looking shadow.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>The fourth value sets the base color of the shadow.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Try experimenting with different values to see how it changes the appearance.</p>
              <h2>Centering the image</h2>
              <pre><code class="lang-css">
                img {
                  display: block;
                  margin: 0 auto;
                }              
              </code></pre>
              <p>Next, we center the image to make it look better. We could use the
                <span class="selectors">margin: 0 auto</span> trick again as we did for the body. But there are differences that 
                require an additional setting to make the CSS work.</p>
              <p>The <span class="selectors"><a class="link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body">&ltbody&gt</a></span> is a block element, meaning it takes up space on the page. 
                The margin applied to a block element will be respected by other elements 
                on the page. In contrast, images are inline elements, for the auto margin 
                trick to work on this image, we must give it block-level behavior using 
                <span class="selectors">display: block;</span>.</p>
              <p class="note">Note: The instructions above assume that you're using an 
                image smaller than the width set on the body. (600 pixels) If your image 
                is larger, it will overflow the body, spilling into the rest of the page. 
                To fix this, you can either: 1) reduce the image width using a 
                <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics_editor">graphics editor</a>, 
                or 2) use CSS to size the image by setting the <span class="selectors">width</span> property on 
                the <span class="selectors">&ltimg&gt</span> element with a smaller value.</p>
              <p class="note">Note: Don't be too concerned if you don't completely 
                understand display: block; or the differences between a block element 
                and an inline element. It will make more sense as you continue your 
                study of CSS. You can find more information about different display 
                values on MDN's <a class="link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display">display reference page</a> .</p>
